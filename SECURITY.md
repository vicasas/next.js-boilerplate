## Reporting a vulnerability

Security is our top priority. If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly by following these steps:

1. **Do not publicly disclose the vulnerability.**
2. **Contact us via email** at [security@example.com](mailto:security@example.com).
3. Provide a detailed description of the vulnerability, including steps to reproduce it.
4. If possible, suggest a potential fix or mitigation strategy.

We will investigate all reported vulnerabilities and respond as soon as possible to address the issue.

## Bug Bounty Program

We encourage ethical hackers and security researchers to help us identify vulnerabilities. While we do not currently offer financial rewards, we recognize and appreciate all responsible disclosures.
